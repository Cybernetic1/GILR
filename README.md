# GILR
Genetic Inductive Learning of Logic Rules

Very simple genetic programming demo
====================================

This is from the book _Clever Algorithms_ :

    python genetic-programming-1.py

To try Rete
===========

Rete is like a minimalist logic engine.

    python genifer.py
    
where `python` means `python3`

How to run tests (for Rete)
===========================

Install pytest (possibly also pytest-benchmark) via:

    pip3 install pytest
    pip3 install pytest-benchmark
    
python3 -m pytest test/*_test.py
